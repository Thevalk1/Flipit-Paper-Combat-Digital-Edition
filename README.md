# Flipit-Paper-Combat-Digital-Edition
A digital version of a tabletop game based on World War II on the fictional world of Jurop, set on the onset of war. 

Flipit: Paper Combat is a fast-paced tabletop miniatures game in a setting similar to WWII. Players lead forces from one of the four major nations into the conflict for Jurop. Armies are built of models players can download, print and build for almost free (you still have to supply the ink, paper, and glue). There are simple starter rules available, which may be supplimented by optional advanced rules to make gameplay more challenging.

All heck has broken loose across the planet as the second big war rages on. The Black X army, led by Durp Furror has embarked on a campaign called the Third Strike to conquorJurop. Nothing seems to stop them as they send thier forces into nearby villages to beat up old men and steal candy from babies. With their modern machines of mechanized mayhem they seek to enslave the entire globe under their malevolent rule. At first, other nations were content to stay out of the war, but with the Third Strike's reach growing ever closer, they find themselves thrust into the conflict.
